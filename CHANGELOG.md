* Some adventures could load the wrong adventures data onto the scene! Notably WDH. This was a subtle bug that only appeared due to a particular duplication if the id used to identify the scene as well as scene enhancements added out of order. I don't think it impacted other adventures, but may have done.
* Some general improvements around scenes in Foundry v10, and how data is loaded.
* The next major release of Adventure Muncher is likely to drop support for Foundry v9. I suspect this will be around the time v11 enters a stable release cycle.

# 1.3.5

# 1.3.4

* Note pins would be generated for some adventures, in some circumstances, even if you didn't want them to be.
* In some circumstances the hints for what monsters/spells/items that are needed for an adventure were not generated for DDB Importer.

# 1.1.1

* Generation of adventures for v9 would fail to generate content for Journals.

# 1.1.0

* Support for generating adventures without Note Pin pages, in v10 the latest DDB Importer can jump to links within Journal Pages instead.
* Bug in Journal Pin generation which could produce empty pins in some circumstances.

# 1.0.9

* Support to allow all DDB Importer to import all adventure actors into the world, and to link to world actors in journals.

# 0.7.0

* Foundry v10 Adventure Generation mode for new style combined Journals. Pins and Handouts are still generated separately.
* Some improvements to linking in documents.
* Tokens will always be generated for scenes, ddb-importer removes dead tokens from scenes if it can't find links.
* Option to reduce the number of hand outs generated. This is useful in the latest version if DDB Importer to reduce the number of journal entries, as handouts can now be generated for players by hovering over images and read aloud sections. There is a slim chance that some of these handouts have been used for Map Notes/Pins. Images/maps marked as Player versions will always be generated as handouts.
