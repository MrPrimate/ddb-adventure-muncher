# DDB Adventure Importer Alpha

Please do not share this link with other people.

## How does this work?

* You will need to import monsters, spells, and items using DDB Importer first.
* When you are happy with the data in your compendiums, you can use the Adventure Config Exporter button to download a config mapping. You can find this in the Experimental tab of the muncher screen if your supporter tier can access the alpha and are using v0.6.25+ of DDB Importer.
* This file contains a cobalt cookie value and mappings to the imported compendium entries. The adventure muncher will use these to construct links to the right spells/items etc in Journal entries.

## Importing the book

You will need to use [Adventure Importer/Exporter Module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/adventure-import-export/), however this does not yet contain the changes needed to import journal images (as of version 0.6.0). Please install from [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrprimate/adventure-import-export/ddb-release/module.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrprimate/adventure-import-export/ddb-release/module.json).


## Config
### Where is the config and downloaded adventure data stored?

You can use `Help -> Config location` menu item to find your config folder.

Likely paths:

* Linux: `~/.config/ddb-adventure-muncher`
* Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/ddb-adventure-muncher`
* Windows: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\ddb-adventure-muncher`

## Reset

If you wish to reset your config use the `File -> Reset config` menu item.

The Adventure Module also generates a database of "lookup ids" for you. This is so that when you reimport an adventure it will overwrite the existing Scenes/Journal entries. It's likely in this early development phase you may need to remove this, use the `File -> Reset generated ids` menu item.

### Delete downloads

If you wish to download the content again, rather than using existing downloaded content, delete the folder called `content` in your config directory, or you can use the `File -> Remove downloaded files`.

## Command Line

If you want to use the app as a command line tool, you can:

```shell
‚ùØ ./ddb-adventure-muncher-0.0.9-linux-x86_64.AppImage --help
./ddb-adventure-muncher <command> [options]

Commands:
  ddb-adventure-muncher version   Version information
  ddb-adventure-muncher list      List books
  ddb-adventure-muncher download  Download all the book files you have access.
                                  This does not process the book, just downloads
                                  for later use.
  ddb-adventure-muncher generate  Generate content for specified book.
  ddb-adventure-muncher config    Load a config file into the importer.

Options:
  -o, --show-owned-books  Show only owned books, not shared.
      --help              Show help                                    [boolean]
  -v, --version           Show version number                          [boolean]

Examples:
  ddb-adventure-muncher generate lmop  Generate import file for Lost Mines of
                                       Phandelver
```

## Known Issues

* Most of the Handouts are un-named because it's hard to parse names - I'll be collecting naming suggestions at some point.
* There are no small entries for pins on the map right now.
* There are no actors placed on the scene right now.

## Current Scene Support

Books with Aligned, Walled, and Lit scenes:

* Lost Mines of Phandelver.

If you wish to help improve the scene wall and lighting information, see the below section.

## Contribution

### Walls and Lighting information

* If you wish to add walls/lighting information you can turn on a setting in Foundry to allow you to support data from a supported map. (VTTA or ddb-adventure-muncher).
* Open the Chrome Developer Console (F12) and run `game.settings.get("ddb-importer", "allow-scene-download", true)`
* Now when you right click on a scene navigation button you will get the option to download the associated data.
* Upload this to the #scene-adjustments channel on Discord with a description of your changes.

### Missed parsing

If you find a missing scene, or something has just not parsed right please let me know on Discord.

There are a number of handouts/images that are just numbered Handout 1/2/3/etc.
If you have a good name for one of these handouts please make a note of it.
I will be starting to collect this information in a shared google sheet in the coming weeks.
