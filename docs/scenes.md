# Contribution to Scenes

## Scene adjustments

* Scenes will export:
  * Links to places notes/pins
  * Information about tokens placed from the DDB Monster Compendium
  * Lights
  * Global illumination
  * Alignment and scaling
  * Walling and doors
  * Drawings

## How?
* You need to be using v3.0.0+ of ddb-importer.
* Open the Chrome Developer Console (F12) and run `game.settings.set("ddb-importer", "allow-scene-download", true)`
* Now when you right click on a scene navigation button you will get the option to download the associated data (DDB Scene Config).
* Fill out the form and upload the json file [here](https://forms.gle/NvyRWdUxi9Dho4As9)

## Stairways module

If you export scenes with stairways data included, that will be added in to the generated scenes.

## Missed parsing

If you find a missing scene, or something has not parsed right please let me know on Discord.

There are a number of handouts/images that are numbered Handout 1/2/3/etc.
If you have a good name for one of these handouts please make a note of it.
