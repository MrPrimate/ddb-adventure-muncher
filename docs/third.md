# Importing Third Party Adventures

If you own the content on D&D Beyond you can link the monsters and journal pins to a number of third party maps.
For this guide we will assume you are using "Tor's Tomb of the Nine Gods" for "Tomb of Annihilation".

1. Import and activate Foundry modules:
 - D&D Beyond Importer
 - Tor's Tomb of the Nine Gods
2. Set Up D&D Beyond Importer and Adventure Muncher. There's a useful guide [here](https://docs.ddb.mrprimate.co.uk/). 
3. Import the Tor's Tomb of the Nine Gods Scenes into your game so they are present. (Right click on the compendium and import - some modules may use Scene Packer and will pop up a dialogue to install the module - let scene packer do it's thing and import the scenes for you).
4. Import the Tomb of Annihilation adventure using Adventure Muncher and DDB Importer (see [here](https://docs.ddb.mrprimate.co.uk/#adventure-muncher) .
5. Once imported, once again open DDB Muncher in Foundry, select the Adventures tab and select `Enhance Third Party Scenes`. Then select `Tor's Tomb of the Nine Gods`.
6. Success!
